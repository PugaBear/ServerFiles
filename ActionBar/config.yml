# About: Minecraft 1.8 features a text above the action bar
#        This plugin will allow you to create a customizable text 
#        for the actionbar.
#
#        This plugin supports variables.

# Permissions: To use the action groups give them the permission
#              actionbar.group.<group>
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groups
#              when giving a new permission.

# Commands: List of all commands
#           /actionbar reload     -  Reload the configuration
#           /actionbar broadcast  -  Broadcast a message

# Variables: These variables can be used in the TEXT section
#            of both the header as the footer.
#            
#            {PLAYER}       - Player name
#            {PLAYERNICK}   - Player nickname
#            {SERVER}       - Server name
#            {PLAYERCOUNT}  - Server player count
#            {BUNGEECOUNT}  - Bungee network player count
#            4000+ more ... see spigot page

# Formatting: These are formatting tags allowing you to format the animations
#             or placeholders.
#
#             Substring: This allows you to split a word (even a placeholder) in parts
#               example: <substring begin=0 end=3>Hello World</substring> = Hel
#               usage: This can be used to split placeholders when creating a typewriter
#                      or to split the colors in a placeholder.
#
#             Scroll: This creates a scrolling animation of the text inside it. It accepts
#                     two arguments (the length and space between scrolls).
#               example: <scroll width=20 spaces=20>&2This is a &atest</scroll>

# Toggling allows you to disable the actionbar
database:
  # If you want the toggle to stay even when your users
  # log off you can enable this. Keep in mind that this requires a
  # MySQL or SQLite database.
  # If you are configuring the plugin for the first time it is advised
  # to stay away from these settings until you managed the actionbar
  # set up.

# While you can use this plugin to show a constant showing text/animation on the bottom
# using permissions, you can also switch between actionbar groups using
# announcements. Announcements allow you to 'switch' between the different
# groups a player has permission to. This allows you for example to show
# some server advertising but do not show it to donators (if you make sure they
# don't have permission to the "advertisement")
announcements:
  # Do you want to enable announcements for the actionbar plugin
  # enabling this will loop through all actionbar groups that have "is-announcement" enabled
  # and the player has permission to.
  # It will change between the groups every "change-interval" in seconds
  enabled: false
  # The interval to change between announcements (Every x seconds)
